## MergeSort

/2016-08-10/

MATLAB code;

Sorts a list to increasing order,
using a version of the Merge Sort algorithm.
When the length of the list is not a power of 2,
the code fills the list up to the next power of 2,
by adding elements larger than the original max. valued element.

The list should be given through the "list" parameter as a row vector.

Outputs the sorted list to terminal.
